Sure, here are the answers to your questions without any formatting:

1. List the Operators in Java:

   - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, % (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo)
   - Relational Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= (equality, inequality, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to)
   - Logical Operators: &&, ||, ! (logical AND, logical OR, logical NOT)
   - Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (simple assignment, addition assignment, subtraction assignment, multiplication assignment, division assignment, modulo assignment)
   - Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, -- (increment, decrement)
   - Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>> (bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, bitwise NOT, left shift, right shift, unsigned right shift)
   - Conditional (Ternary) Operator: ? : (conditional expression)
   - instanceof Operator: Used to test if an object is an instance of a class or interface.

2. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples:

   - Increment Operator (++): It increases the value of a variable by 1.
   - Decrement Operator (--): It decreases the value of a variable by 1.

   Example:
   int x = 5;
   int y = 10;
   x++; // After this, x is 6
   y--; // After this, y is 9

3. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
   Conditional operators in Java include the following:
   - Conditional (Ternary) Operator: It is represented as `? :` and is used for conditional expressions. It returns one of two values based on a condition.

4. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
   Operators in Java can be categorized based on the number of operands into:
   - Unary Operators (operate on one operand)
   - Binary Operators (operate on two operands)
   - Ternary Operator (conditional operator, operates on three operands)

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
   Conditional statements in Java are used to make decisions in a program. They allow you to execute different code blocks based on conditions. Common conditional statements include if, else if, else, and switch.

6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
   The basic syntax of the `if-else` statement in Java is as follows:
   if (condition) {
   } else {
   }
   ```

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
   The three types of iterative statements (loops) in Java are:
   - for loop
   - while loop
   - do-while loop

8. What do you mean by an Array?
   An array in Java is a data structure that stores a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays are used to group related data items under a single name for easier access and manipulation.

9. How to create an Array?
   You can create an array in Java using the following syntax:
   data_type[] array_name = new data_type[array_size];
10. State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java:
    - StringBuffer is synchronized, which means it is thread-safe, but this can impact performance in a multi-threaded environment.
    - StringBuilder is not synchronized, offering better performance in a single-threaded environment but is not thread-safe.
